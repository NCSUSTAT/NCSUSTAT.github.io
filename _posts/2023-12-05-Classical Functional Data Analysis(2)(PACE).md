## Introduction to PACE(Principal Analysis by Conditional Expectation)
  Classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. In contrast, We propose a nonparametric method to perform functional principal components analysis for the case of sparse longitudinal data. The method aims at irregularly spaced longitudinal data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small.
  
## Improvements over Previous Studies
- The inclusion of additional measurement errors represents a significant improvement.
- The method effectively manages sparse and irregular longitudinal data.
   - In particular, it efficiently reconstructs random trajectories by integrating information from both individual cases and the entire dataset during the construction of estimated mean 
    functions, covariance functions, and the prediction of FPC scores through a Bayesian approach. I will elaborate on this process, emphasizing how the method leverages information from the 
    entire dataset to estimate individual trajectories.



  
## Estimation of Mean Function

Historical signals $s_{ij}$:

  $i=1,...,N$: signal index
  
  $j=1,...,m_i$: observation index in each signal

 $S_{i}(t_{ij}) = \mu(t_{ij}) + \Sigma_{k=1}^{\infty} \xi_{ik} \varphi_{k}(t_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij}$, where $E(\epsilon_{ij})=0, var(\epsilon_{ij})=\sigma^{2}$

We can estimate the mean function $\hat{\mu}(t)$ using local linear regression by minimizing:

 $\min_{c_0,c_1}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} \Sigma_{j=1}^{m_i} W(\frac{t - t_{ij}}{h})(s_{i}(t_{ij}) - c_0 - (t - t_{ij})c_1 )^2$


The solution is given by:

$\hat{\mu}(t) = \hat{c}_0(t)$

## Estimation of Covariance Function

First, we use the estimated mean functions to estimate the raw covariance function $\hat{C}(t, t'):$

$\hat{C_i}(t_{ij}, t_{ik}) = (s_i(t_{ij}) - \hat{\mu}(t_{ij}))(s_i(t_{ik}) - \hat{\mu}(t_{ik}))$

- $\hat{C_i}(t_{ij}, t_{ik})$ is the covariance between observations $i$ at times $t_{ij}$ and $t_{ik}$.
- $s_i(t_{ij})$ is the signal at observation $i$ and time $t_{ij}$.
- $\hat{\mu}(t_{ij})$ is the estimated mean function at time $t_{ij}$.
- $s_i(t_{ik})$ is the signal at observation $i$ and time $t_{ik}$.
- $\hat{\mu}(t_{ik})$ is the estimated mean function at time $t_{ik}$.

The minimization problem is as follows:

$\min_{c_0, c_1, c_2} \Sigma_{i=1}^{n} \Sigma_{1 \leq j \neq k \leq m_i} W(\frac{t_{i,j} - t}{h},\frac{t_{i,k} - t}{h}) (\hat{C_i}(t_{i,j}, t_{i,k}) - c_0 - c_1(t - t_{i,j}) - c_2(t' - t_{i,k}))^2$

To estimate the covariance surface $\hat{C}(t, t')$, we use local quadratic regression. The solution is given by:

$\hat{C}(t, t') = \hat{c}_0(t, t')$

To solve the estimated covariance function, $\hat{\phi}_k(t)$ is estimated by discretizing the estimated covariance function $\hat{C}(t, t')$.

## Computing FPC-Scores

The best prediction of the FPC scores for the $i$th subject, given the data from that individual, is the conditional expectation, which, under Gaussian assumptions is found to be 

$\tilde{\xi_{ik}} = E[\xi_{ik}|\tilde{Y_i}] = \lambda_k \phi_{ik}^T \Sigma_{Y_i}^{-1}(\tilde{Y_i} - \mu_i) $
, where $\Sigma_{Y_i} = \text{cov}(\tilde{Y_i},\tilde{Y_i}) = \text{cov}(\tilde{X_i},\tilde{X_i}) + \sigma^2I_{N_i}$ 

that is, the $(j, l)$ entry of the $N_i \times N_i$ matrix $\Sigma_{Y_i}$ is 

 ${(\Sigma_{Y_i})}_{j,l}=G(T_{ij},T_{il})+\sigma^2 \delta_{jl} $ 
 
 with $\delta_{jl} = 1$ if $j = l$ and $0$ if $j \neq l$.

Estimates for the FPC scores $\xi_{ik}$ are obtained from (4), by substituting estimates of $\mu_i$, $\lambda_k$, and $\phi_{ik}$, $\Sigma_{Y_i}$ obtained from the entire data ensemble, leading to

\hat{\xi_{ik}} = \hat{E}[\xi_{ik}|\tilde{Y_i}] = \hat{\lambda_k}\hat{\phi_{ik}}^T\hat{\Sigma_{Y_i}}^{-1}(\tilde{Y_i} - \hat{\mu_i}), (5)

where the $(j, l)$th element of $\hat{\Sigma_{Y_i}}$ is $(\hat{\Sigma_{Y_i}_{j,l}} = \hat{G(T_{ij},T_{il})} + \hat{\sigma}^2\delta_{jl}$.
