# Data Application
The methodologies will be applied to longitudinal datasets featured in primary papers. These datasets
present unique statistical challenges, such as irregular observation points and sparse longitudinal data, with
notable gaps in the off-diagonal regions.

## Spinal Bone Mineral Density Dataset (Li et al., 2021)
The Spinal Bone Mineral Density dataset, as introduced by Li et al. (2021), serves as a real-world application
of the proposed methodologies. This dataset captures longitudinal measurements of bone mineral density at
various spinal locations. The irregular observation points and sparse nature of the data pose challenges for
conventional statistical methods.

- Irregular Observation Points
The irregularity in the observation points requires the methodologies to adapt to varying data densities and
handle snippets with different temporal resolutions.
Sparse Longitudinal Data
The datasetâ€™s sparsity necessitates robust methodologies capable of deriving meaningful estimates even in
the presence of limited data points.

- Gaps in the Off-Diagonal Regions
Notable gaps in the off-diagonal regions of the covariance structure present challenges for capturing dependencies between non-adjacent time points. Our estimators will be evaluated on their ability to fill these gaps
and provide accurate representations of the underlying covariance surface.

- Methodological Evaluation
The application of our methodologies to these datasets will involve fitting the estimators to the observed
longitudinal data and critically evaluating the accuracy and robustness of the resulting mean and covariance
function estimates.
The challenges presented by these datasets offer a realistic testing ground for the proposed methodologies,
allowing us to assess their practical applicability and effectiveness in handling complexities inherent in realworld longitudinal data
