# Explain
Prove that every v.s. $X$ has a Hamel basis.\\
 (proof)Let $M$ be the set of all linearly independent subset of $X$.Since $X \neq 0$, it follows that $M \neq 0$.Note that set inclusion defines a partial ordering on $M$, and that every chain $C \subset M$ has an upper bound, which is union of all subsets of $X$.By Zorn's Lemma, $M$ has a maximal element, say B.\\(claim) B is Hamel basis for $X$, that is, $span B=Y$ and $Y=X$.\\(proof of claim) Suppose, to the contrary, that $Y \subsetneq X$. Then, $\exists z \in X$ s.t. $z \notin Y$. It follows that $B \cup \{z\}$ is the linearly independent set containing $B$ as a proper subset, contrary to the maximality of $B$.
